# ABGame
to run the program, 
#### first, copy the ABGame.jar file from the directory /out/artifacts/ABGame_jar/ to your desired root directory second, 
#### open the terminal and type the command 
##   java -jar ANDEquation.jar <input.txt> <output.txt>

### The <input.txt> <output.txt> values should either be 
####     - an absolute path to the text file or 
####     - just the file name. (the program will lookup/save the file in default location) 
####     - In this case you need to create a directory named "files" in the root directory, where the jar file is located. 
####     - then create 2 directories in files/ named "input" and "output" 
####     *- The default lookup location for the input file is ./files/input/ 
####     *- The default save location for the output file is ./files/output/

The input (Text) for the AND equation should be on 2 lines. the first one with the initial String, and the secon with the target. For example

"B"
"ABBA"
